 <h1>THE TERES MINOR MUSCLE</h1> 
 <p>The teres minor is a narrow, narrow muscle in the shoulder that is one of the four muscles of the rotator cuff. It connects the scapula to the humerus and its main functions are to externally rotate the arm and stabilize the shoulder joint by holding the head of the humerus in the shoulder socket. The muscle is innervated by the axillary nerve. 
Location and anatomy
Location: It is a small muscle located on the posterior side of the shoulder, superior to the teres major and inferior to the infraspinatus.
Origin: It originates from the lateral border of the scapula.
Insertion: It inserts into the greater tubercle of the humerus. 
Function
External rotation: Its primary action is to externally (or laterally) rotate the arm.
Shoulder stabilization: As part of the rotator cuff, it plays a crucial role in stabilizing the glenohumeral (shoulder) joint by keeping the head of the humerus centered in the socket.
Other actions: It assists with arm adduction and extension and can help in abduction when the arm is stabilized. 
Innervation and blood supply 
Nerve: The axillary nerve provides the nerve supply to the teres minor.
Artery: It is supplied with blood by the posterior circumflex humeral artery and the circumflex scapular artery.</p>
