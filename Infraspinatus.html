  <h1>THE INFRASPINATUS MUSCLE</h1> 
  <p>The infraspinatus is a triangular muscle located on the posterior side of the scapula that belongs to the rotator cuff group. Its main functions are to externally rotate the arm and to help stabilize the shoulder joint, which is one of the most mobile joints in the body. It originates in the infraspinous fossa and inserts on the greater tubercle of the humerus.  
Anatomy and function
Location: The infraspinatus is a thick, triangular muscle on the back of the shoulder blade (scapula), situated underneath the spine of the scapula in the infraspinous fossa. 
Origin: It originates from the infraspinous fossa and the internal surface of the infraspinous fascia. 
Insertion: It inserts via a flat tendon onto the middle facet of the greater tubercle of the humerus (upper arm bone). 
Rotator Cuff: It is one of the four muscles of the rotator cuff, along with the supraspinatus, teres minor, and subscapularis. These muscles work together to provide stability to the shoulder</p>
